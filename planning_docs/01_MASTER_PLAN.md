# Interior Design Project Estimator - Master Plan

## Executive Summary

This tool will help 1584 Interior Design estimate project budgets by intelligently determining room configurations and calculating costs based on property characteristics and client quality preferences.

---

## 1. DATA ARCHITECTURE RECOMMENDATION

### What Should Be **STRUCTURED DATABASE** (Firebase Firestore):
✅ **RECOMMENDED: Store everything in structured database, minimize vectorization**

**Rationale:**
- Your data is already highly structured with clear categories
- Room types, items, quantities, and pricing are deterministic
- Changes to pricing/items need immediate, consistent updates
- No ambiguity or semantic search needed for this data

**Firestore Collections Structure:**

```
/items (master item catalog)
  └─ {itemId}
      - name: "King Bed Frame"
      - category: "bedroom_furniture"
      - budgetPrice: 500
      - midPrice: 1500
      - midHighPrice: 3000
      - highPrice: 8000

/roomTemplates
  └─ {roomType} (e.g., "living_room")
      └─ sizes/{sizeId} (e.g., "small", "medium", "large")
          - displayName: "Small Living Room"
          - totalItems: [
              { itemId: "sofa_sectional", quantity: 1 },
              { itemId: "accent_chairs", quantity: 2 },
              ...
            ]
          - calculatedTotals: { budget: 8285, mid: 16890, ... }

/propertyProfiles (suggested room configurations)
  └─ {profileId}
      - name: "4BR Vacation Rental"
      - squareFootageMin: 2000
      - squareFootageMax: 3000
      - guestCapacityMin: 8
      - guestCapacityMax: 12
      - suggestedRooms: [
          { type: "living_room", size: "medium", quantity: 1 },
          { type: "kitchen", size: "large", quantity: 1 },
          ...
        ]

/projects (user saved estimates)
  └─ {projectId}
      - clientName: "..."
      - createdAt: timestamp
      - propertySpecs: {...}
      - selectedRooms: [...]
      - qualityTier: "mid"
      - totalEstimate: {...}
```

### What Could Use **VECTORIZATION + LLM** (Optional Enhancement):
⚠️ **OPTIONAL: Only if you want natural language property descriptions**

**Use Case:** If users enter freeform descriptions like:
> "Large mountain retreat with great room, gourmet kitchen, master suite on main, 3 guest bedrooms upstairs, bunk room for kids, game room in basement, outdoor entertaining spaces"

**Implementation:**
- Vector database: Pinecone or Firebase Vector Search (Beta)
- Embed property type descriptions
- Use LLM to extract room types/quantities from natural language
- **My recommendation: Start without this, add later if needed**

---

## 2. USER INPUT STRATEGY

### Recommended Approach: **HYBRID FORM + OPTIONAL AI ASSIST**

**Primary Input Method: Structured Form**
```
Property Basics:
  - Square Footage: [number input]
  - Max Guest Capacity: [number input]
  - Property Type: [dropdown: Vacation Rental, Primary Residence, Commercial]

Room Configuration Builder:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Common Spaces                       │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ ☑ Living Room    [Small ▼]  Qty: 1 │
  │ ☑ Kitchen        [Large ▼]  Qty: 1 │
  │ ☑ Dining Area    [Medium▼]  Qty: 1 │
  │ ☐ Rec Room       [Medium▼]  Qty: 1 │
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘
  
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Sleeping Spaces                     │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ ☑ Single Bedroom [Medium▼]  Qty: 3 │
  │ ☑ Double Bedroom [Large ▼]  Qty: 1 │
  │ ☑ Bunk Room      [Small ▼]  Qty: 1 │
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘

Quality Preference:
  ○ Budget  ○ Mid-Range  ● Mid/High  ○ High-End
```

**Secondary Option: AI-Assisted Configuration**
- Button: "Describe your property instead"
- Text area for natural language input
- LLM parses and populates the form
- User reviews/adjusts before calculating

**Why This Approach:**
1. ✅ Structured form is faster, more accurate, gives control
2. ✅ Matches your existing data structure perfectly
3. ✅ No AI needed initially - can launch faster
4. ✅ Can add AI assist later as enhancement
5. ✅ Users see exactly what they're estimating

---

## 3. INTELLIGENT DEFAULTS & SUGGESTIONS

Even without heavy LLM use, we can provide smart suggestions:

**Logic-Based Recommendations:**

```javascript
function suggestRoomConfiguration(squareFootage, guestCapacity) {
  const recommendations = [];
  
  // Always include basics
  recommendations.push({ room: 'kitchen', size: 'medium', quantity: 1 });
  recommendations.push({ room: 'living_room', size: 'medium', quantity: 1 });
  
  // Bedrooms based on guest capacity
  const bedroomCapacity = Math.ceil(guestCapacity / 2);
  if (bedroomCapacity >= 5) {
    recommendations.push({ room: 'bunk_room', size: 'medium', quantity: 1 });
  }
  
  // Size recommendations based on square footage
  if (squareFootage > 3000) {
    recommendations.forEach(r => {
      if (r.size === 'medium') r.size = 'large';
    });
  }
  
  // Optional spaces for larger properties
  if (squareFootage > 2500) {
    recommendations.push({ room: 'rec_room', size: 'medium', quantity: 1 });
  }
  
  return recommendations;
}
```

**Implementation Phases:**
- **Phase 1:** Manual form input only
- **Phase 2:** Add smart suggestions based on property specs
- **Phase 3:** Add AI-powered natural language parsing (optional)

## 7. DATA QUALITY ISSUES TO ADDRESS

I noticed some inconsistencies in your CSVs that need fixing:

**Issues Found:**
1. **Single Bedroom CSV**: Lines 3-8 have "$3.00" and "$4.00" instead of proper prices for Mid/High and High tiers
2. **Rec Room CSV**: Missing pricing data for most items except the Large Game Table
3. **Double Bedroom CSV**: Missing pricing data after row 18

**Recommendation:**
- Clean up the data before importing
- Use the "Item Pricing" master sheet as source of truth
- Create validation script to catch missing prices

---

## 8. CALCULATION LOGIC

### Budget Calculation Formula:

```javascript
function calculateProjectEstimate(rooms, qualityTier) {
  const estimate = {
    rooms: [],
    subtotal: 0,
    contingency: 0,  // 10% buffer
    total: 0
  };
  
  rooms.forEach(room => {
    const template = getRoomTemplate(room.type, room.size);
    let roomTotal = 0;
    
    template.items.forEach(item => {
      const itemPrice = getItemPrice(item.itemId, qualityTier);
      const lineTotal = itemPrice * item.quantity * room.quantity;
      roomTotal += lineTotal;
    });
    
    estimate.rooms.push({
      type: room.type,
      size: room.size,
      quantity: room.quantity,
      total: roomTotal
    });
    
    estimate.subtotal += roomTotal;
  });
  
  estimate.contingency = estimate.subtotal * 0.10;
  estimate.total = estimate.subtotal + estimate.contingency;
  
  return estimate;
}
```

### Range Display:
- Show "Budget Range" → calculate with Budget tier
- Show "High-End Range" → calculate with High tier
- Display as: **$XX,XXX - $XX,XXX**
- Allow user to see mid-tiers on demand

## 9. VISUAL DESIGN DIRECTION

- Clean, professional
- Inspired by: Notion, Linear, Modern SaaS tools
- Color Palette: Professional but warm
  - Primary: Deep navy or sage green
  - Accent: Gold/bronze (luxury feel)
  - Neutral: Warm grays

### Key Screens:
1. **Landing/Input Page**: Simple, focused form
2. **Configuration Builder**: Interactive room selector
3. **Estimate Results**: Beautiful breakdown with charts
4. **Comparison View**: Side-by-side quality tiers
